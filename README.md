Adjust SubTitle
===============

Adjust SubTitle is a simple yet still-need-enhancements code to change your favorite movie's subtitle.

Scenario
--------
Imagine you're in the middle of your movie and the subtitle is somewhat 2 seconds faster or 4 seconds slower.
You need to adjust it but you don't want to change the time one by one (ouch!)

Usage
-----
Read the code. If you want to know more about the SRT file format,
